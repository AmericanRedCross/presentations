				<aside class="notes">The first 72 hours were insane for our team. We had to build an operational understanding of what and stuff happened so staff from the American Red Cross and the International Federation for the Red Cross/Red Crescent could plan where to go, what do do, and how to get there.</aside>

				<aside class="notes">we realized pretty quickly that our little team of 4 wasn't going to be able keep up. Months earlier over geobeers at FOSS4G we convinced the British Red Cross to help us out and they've done lots of work to keep the maps and data flowing.</aside>

			<section data-background="images/please.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">we started asking for data, basically everyone was asking each other for the same data, it either didn't exist or it was in pdf</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/satan.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">when we did start to get data it was often in pdf. PDF does not equal open data. Data must be machine readable processable and above all else require little to no work to reuse</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/theif.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">We started mining websites and reverse engineering web services to get data. We used an army of volunteers, including folks here who donated time over the weekend and at night to free data locked away in pdfs into real useable data</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/awesome.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Folks in the USG were awesome and always gave us great relevant data in spatial formats we could use with open data licenses. When we got data either from the USG or other reliable places we would immediatly share it with the HOT team to prioritize tasks for not only the hardest hit areas but the areas where Humanitarian aid would be going first and then working out from there.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/opensource.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">We started talking and embracing open data just over a year ago with a big commitment in the last 6 months. This event has proven and reinforced all of the reasons why open data and open platforms are awesome. At SOTM US last year just after joining Red Cross I asked the OSM and larger geospatial community to help people help people. You guys lived up to that request and then some.</aside>
