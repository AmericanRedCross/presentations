			<section data-background="images/haiti_earthquake.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">After the Haiti Earthquake in 2010 the need and desire for programs and disaster situational awareness drastically changed. the haiti earthquake was a huge catalyst to change how the American Red Cross opperated and managed our data.</aside>

			<section data-background="images/excel.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">We were living in the pre-cloud era, what data we did have was in different excel files scattered around the organization.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/nottalking.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">which basically meant that even if we wanted to we couldn't easily talk to one antoher and share data about even the most basic things like where are projects were.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/system.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">a long time ago someone at the red cross said we need a system. A way to organize our data. It would be magical.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/404cat.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">However, the organization and the technology were not ready yet. This process was 17 years in the making.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/salesforce.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Now that the organizations data was put into Salesforce we had one huge problem it wasn't spatial data. Salesforce lacks an out of the box solution to geospatial locations.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/what.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Its around this time that I joined the Red Cross. My first assignment was to show salesforce data on a map.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/hackers.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">my brilliant idea was to let someone way smarter than me try to figure it out. I met Ryan at the first JS.geo a while back and thought, hey he was cool. "somehow" they managed to beat out a couple of closed source companies that will remain nameless. Being in DC we didn't want the typical DC beltway bandit, we wanted someone that had dealt with humanitarian issues before</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background="images/parent.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Dale starts, then Ryan's Slide. Parent/Child Relationships: The first problem was to somehow link project "locations" to actual geographies so we could map it. One of the requirements was to be able to aggregate the data from small geographies up to country and ultimatly our own custom regions.</aside>
			</section>
        		<section data-background="images/rerun.gif" data-background-size="contain">
                <aside class="notes">Ryan's Slide: Chubbs Server, AKA Spatial Server.  We wanted a lightweight yet flexible way to serve up GeoJSON, with the ability to query and aggregate and customize the output.  Node.js & PostGIS project called Chubbs.</aside>
            </section>
            <section data-background="images/heavylifting.gif" data-background-size="contain">
                <aside class="notes">Ryan's Slide: We then needed a way to get our hands on the data inside of Salesforce.  Yes, there is an API, but we needed to be able to preprocess, join and merge the data with the spatial data in our PostGIS instance. So, we created our own simple ETL called succubus.</aside>
            </section>
			<section data-background="images/smart.gif" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">Ryan's Slide: SmartGADM - choosing the correct shapes(boundaries) based on what the user is looking at. The first first problem though was to chose what boundary data to use. Long story short all global admin boundaries suck. We ended up using GADM because it had the best coverage but we had to spend a lot of time to clean it up.</aside>

			<section data-background="images/gadm_gif2.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<h3><a href="https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/simplegadm" target="_blank">SimpleGADM</a></h3>
				<aside class="notes">Dale's Slide: Caveats GADM has all kinds of issues including some bad geometry that prevented us from just puting it into PostGIS and running st_simplify. Not to mention it also doesn't have a clean license. We ended up cleaning it up using a proces that involved QGIS, GRASS, and a really big Amazon EC2 instance. Becuase of the license we can't redistribute simpleGADM but we can tell you how to make your own. This process should work for any boundary dataset and we are looking into doing it for others like GAUL and NE.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/easy.gif" data-background-size="contain">
			    <aside class="notes">Dale's Slide: Once we had the boundary stack figured out it was "easy" to have Ryan's team wire everything up.</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
					<h3><a href="https://webviz.redcross.org/placesearch/search.html">location lookup</a></h3>
					<aside class="notes">Dale's Slide: We created a location lookup site that allows users to select the place where the project is. First iteration was too slow for large geometries such as indonesia or india, we replaces the simplified geojson from postgis with a vector tile server directly from chubbs.</aside>
			</section>
            <section data-background="images/labeling.gif" data-background-size="contain">
                <aside class="notes">Ryan's Slide: Smart Labeling - Problem with labeling centroids of large polygons.  We created a library that dynamically calculates the centroid of the VISIBLE area for each polygon, thus ensuring that user is always seeing a label for an area they're looking at (as opposed to pre-calced centroids).</aside>
            </section>
			<section data-background="images/stack.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Ryan's Slide: Talk about tech used, any custom bits. Angular, bootstrap, node.js, phantom.js, leaflet, mbtiles, postgis, Amazaon RDS, Amazon EC2</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/shark.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Closing Slide - Don't be intimidated by the big problems. The problem is never the technology or the code. Its about finding the right people in your organization to be champions and about reusing as much open source code as you can. You are here because you like open source. Contribute, if you can't code document, if you can't document, hire some cool people to do it for you.</aside>
