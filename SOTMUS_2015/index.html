					Red Cross and OSM are a match made in heaven, we started doing more with OSM in 2012 with a mapping project in Gulu, Uganda. OSM has awesome data, lots of amazing volunteers.

					2 years ago at SOTMUS San Francisco I promised that Red Cross would become more and more involved with OSM and HOT. We've held up our end of the bargin. We have invested a lot of time and money into building workflows around OSM, creating data, and now creating OSM tools such as OMK and the OSM-Meta-Util.
