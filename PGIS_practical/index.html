			<section><h1>Participatory GIS</h1></section>
			<section><h2>What is participatory GIS?</h2><h3>Capturing assessment data in GIS formats so it can be analyzed via maps and graphics</h3></section>
			<section><h2>Why participatory GIS?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Help community advocacy -- show vision</li>
					<li>Compare community data to secondary data (government, NSET, etc.)</li>
					<li>Use community data for planning (construction, water points, etc.)</li>
					<li>Make community data reusable</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section><h1>Narrative vs. Map</h1></section>
			<section><h2>Example 1</h2></section>
			<section><blockquote>"There are two wells used by the tole. Both are lower down the hill so when it floods they sometimes get polluted and dirty. But we keep drinking from them, we don't have a choice."<br /><br />"One well is up the hill from the school and hard for the children to reach, so they often go thirsty during the day. All the schools are down the hill nearby the river, in flood range."</blockquote></section>
			<section><h2><img src= "images/ParticipatoryMapping_Bhaktapur-01.png" /></h2></section>
			<section><h2>Example 2</h2></section>
			<section><blockquote>"The lower side of town is really exposed to flooding and that's where most of our main buildings are. The factory, school, main temple and most of the people are all in the usual zone of flooding."<br /><br />"Most of the people have to walk up the main road up the hill to evacuate when there's a flood. This is really hard for disabled people and young children during flash floods, and some have been killed in the past."</blockquote></section>

			<section><h1>Techniques</h1></section>
			<section><h2>Draw the data on paper</h2></section>
			<section><h2>Always ask "where does this happen?"</h2></section>			
			<section><h2>Have community members draw for you</h2></section>
			<section><h2>Explore information related to your question guide</h2></section>
			<section><h2>Ask probing questions: dig deeper with open-ended questions</h2></section>
			<section><h2>If too busy to draw, circle interesting data in your notes and return to it at the end of the session</h2></section>
			<section><h1>Exercises</h1></section>
			<section><blockquote>"Most of the poorer people live on the northern side of the tol, between the A street and the B street. A lot of people there are from the X caste or the Y caste and they tend to make less money because they're employed as day laborers."<br /><br />"People on the south side of the tol are mostly craftspeople and they make more money. They're usually from the WHAT CASTE."</blockquote></section>
			<section><blockquote>"Traffic on the main road moves really fast. The big school is on the other side of this road and children have to cross it. Sometimes children get hit and killed by trucks carrying goods to the industrial area."<br /><br />"We would like to have a crosswalk, signs and a police guard for the school hours to help children cross safely. Or a bridge above the highway for children to walk over."</blockquote></section>
			<section><blockquote>"The whole tole has problems with malaria and other diseases. The area by the river is the worst affected. That's where the poorest people, the people of XYZ caste, live and work"."<br /><br />"There's not many jobs there so most of the people have to walk to the industrial area to work. If people miss work because of sickness they lose their jobs. It's an hour's walk each way. There's a bus but it's too expensive to take for most people."</blockquote></section>
