				<h1>Humanitarian Open Street Map at the Red Cross</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					I’m Dale Kunce from the American Red Cross. I work in the International Services Department focused on events and programs outside the United States.
					<br />I’m going to talk about the Red Cross’s efforts to become more spatially aware and how that prepares us to respond to disasters around the world.

				<h1>I'm new here.</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					I’m new here. Both to the OSM and HOT communities. I’m really excited to get a chance to participate in these communities after years of toiling in old boring GIS shops.
					<br />I’m also new to the Red Cross. I’ve only been working for a couple of weeks. In that time I’ve met some incredibly passionate and capable folks. However, the programs at Red Cross are crying out for some good old geo goodness. A couple days ago in a design charrette for a new Red Cross initiative website, staff said they wanted maps as a key component of the site. When we tried to tease out exactly what they meant they just responded back that they wanted maps.

				<h1>Spatial?</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Spatial? Red cross for years had no GIS staff and had no clear vision of how and when to use a map.

				<h1>Dark Days</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					People collected data without any place for it to go. They wanted maps but didn't know where to get them or what to put on them or even how to use them.<br />
					On the domestic side there is one full time staff to support all Red Cross for the United States while on the international side there were only volunteers and interns.
					<br />Most of Red Cross movement is still in the dark ages. GIS and Geospatial is very new to the organization. Most of our time on our team is spent building capacity in national societies so they can start to use these tools.

				<h1>Haiti Earthquake</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Hatii Earthquake in 2010. It’s a familiar story. We got our asses kicked. We had horrible data and then when we got data we didn’t have a place to store or share the data.
					<br />NGOs under pressure to provide information we didn’t have and couldn’t provide.
					<br />The earthquake served as a major turning point for Red Cross adoption of OSM.
				</aside>

			<section data-background="images/Slide06.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<h1>Where?</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					People just didn't have maps, maybe local print maps. I heard a story that some of the first people on the ground in Haiti used maps from the US military that were last updated in the 1970s.
					<br />This map shows OSM of Port-Au-Prince the day before the earthquake.

			<section data-background="images/Slide08.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<h1>There!!</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					This is Port-au-Prince today. We now have a good understanding of the reach and scope of the work just numbers in a spreadsheet.<br />
					OSM helped a lot but it still took the Red Cross a while to catch-up. The efforts of the OSM community helped to sustained GIS efforts for the next year.

				<h1>Field + Remote</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Red Cross is fundamentally a disaster preparedness and response organization.
					<br />In Haiti we responded to the disaster. Things might have been different if the city was better prepared for the event. Haiti reinforced the need to have better maps before disasters. For our team that means top to bottom training with OSM, field methods first. Stand in the doorwell, walk the center of the street. Create polygons. Tracing data in JOSM, repetition and explaination of the tagging scheme which often doesn’t really work for some communities.
					<br />We teach people how to make basic maps using OSM as a data store and basemap.
					<br />This slide shows volunteers at a Red Cross mapping party in Chile getting aquatinted with a GPS unit before heading out for the day to make some tracks for OSM.

				<h1>Goat Elevation Model</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Red Cross has limited resources we need to be innovative in whatever we are doing. One of our staff members came up with the idea of building an elevation model from a GPS point cloud with data collected by goats.
					<br />While this didn’t actually work, the innovation is the important part. We are embracing other ways of doing things beyond old school desktop GIS.

				<h1>College Students</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Through a couple of professors at George Washington and Tulane we were able to remotely map areas in Indonesia and Columbia.
					<br />This collaboration as a huge success and one that we would like to continue and replicate with other groups.

			<section data-background="images/Slide13.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					Here are some people doing community vulnerability mapping in Uganda. We want to incorporate OSM into these vulnerability studies wherever we go. We want to put the community perception and knowledge into OSM.
					<br />Red Cross wants to use its access and charter to improve people’s lives throughout the world by using OSM.

				<h1>Persuasive</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Communities are very much behind the curve and  starved for maps. 
					<br />Custom maps are really powerful even really really bad ones like this. This is very ugly and people still love it and use it. The most important thing on the map isn’t the elevation but the almost hidden small pink dots on the map.
				</aside>

			<section data-background="images/Slide18.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<h1>Fires</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					We mapped had a huge effort to map Gulu, Uganda. We had several local and remote mapping parties.
					<br />After our base mapping was largely complete we then used that data to feed into community surveys of various hazards.
					<br />This map shows severity of the fire damage. The grey denotes areas household surveyed while the orange shows the level of fire damage.

					Huts and potential fire hazards in Gulu Uganda, all data collected was traced and uploaded to OSM.

			<section data-background="images/Slide23.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					Red Cross is nearly everywhere, we need data everywhere, we want to contribute everywhere. OSM allows us to contribute from the field or remotely.

			<section data-background="images/Slide24.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<h1>Collaborate</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					One of the biggest challenges is the lack of coordination and collaboration between NGO’s. 
					<br />Data ends up being siloed, either within the project, or the organization. Or in the case of the Red Cross within different offices and programs. 
					<br />Red Cross intends our focus on OSM to push collaboration with the local community and with internal and external partners. Data collected in support of Red Cross projects will be pushed to OSM where possible.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/Slide25.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					Red Cross much like OSM is a volunteer organization. We need volunteers to help map the communities we are working in.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/Slide26.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<h1>Help people help people</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Because we will be working so heavily to improve the base map within communities. We hope to reap benefits from the improved OSM base data over time.
					<br />Better maps base data allows us to help people help people improving are ability to prepare and respond to disasters of all types.
