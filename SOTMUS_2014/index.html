				<h2>[HOT] Preparations for Typhoon Haiyan</h2>
				<aside class="notes">Andrew Buck sent out an email to the HOT list to let everyone know that he created a task. At this point we new it was gonna be bad but we had no idea how bad. The Red Cross teams started to pull together basic stuff just encase we were called into action.</aside>

				<aside class="notes">Haiyan made landfall on November 8th with sustained winds of 195mph with gusts of 235mph, a storm surge of 6 meters with waves as high as 12 meters, and affected around 16 million people.<sup><a href"http://unocha.com">[1]</a></sup></aside>

				<h3>Tolusa, Leyte - Nov 8th</h3>
				<aside class="notes">The American Red Cross didn't know we were going to be called up but started to do a data scramble to prep just incase staff were deployed. This map shows the state of OSM in the hard hit town of Tolusa, Leyte on November 8th. We were basically planning on sending people out the door with big pieces of paper.</aside>

			<h3>Nov 9th</h3>
			<h3><i>"Getting feedback from OFDA, from USAID, their DART is saying these areas as priorities..."</i></h3>
				<aside class="notes">At this point we were using media reports to drive our mapping and guessing where our staff would be deployed. Everyone new that Tacloban got hit hard but the outlying rural areas were also of great concern.</aside>

				<h3 style="color:black"><i>"I got authority to release."</i></h3>

				<h3>Where is the imagery?</h3>
				<aside class="notes">In the first couple days loads of people talked and talked about the need for aerial imagery. The need was very high, the desire to provide it was very high, but you know Haiyan was a big !@#$ing storm.</aside>

			<section data-background="images/" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Folks in the USG were awesome and always gave us great relevant data in spatial formats we could use with open data licenses. When we got data either from the USG or other reliable places we would immediately share it with the HOT team to prioritize tasks for not only the hardest hit areas but the areas where Humanitarian aid would be going first and then working out from there.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/theif.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Because we couldn't get other data we needed we started mining websites and reverse engineering web services to get data. We used an army of volunteers who donated time over weekends and at night to free data locked away in pdfs to create real usable data</aside>
