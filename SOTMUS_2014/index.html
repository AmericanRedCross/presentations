This map shows the state of OSM in the hard hit town of Tolusa, Leyte on November 8th. We were basically planning on sending people out the door with big pieces of paper.</aside>

				<aside class="notes">Because we couldn't get other data we needed we started mining websites and reverse engineering web services to get data. We used an army of volunteers who donated time over weekends and at night to free data locked away in pdfs to create real usable data, this data included storm surge, population datasets, and transportation information</aside>
