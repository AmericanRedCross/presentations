				<aside class="notes">Just a reminder that the Red Cross couldn't do nearly the good we do without HOT. HOT is the brains and braun for activations. While we may be very vocal about Red Cross we are also very thankful for everything they do.</aside>

				<h2>Nov 7th</h2>
				<h1>[HOT] Preparations for Typhoon Haiyan</h1>
				<aside class="notes">Andrew Buck sent out an email to the HOT list to let everyone know that he created a task. At this point we new it was gonna be bad but we had no idea how bad. The Red Cross teams started to pull together basic stuff just encase we were called into action.</aside>

				<aside class="notes">Haiyan made landfall on November 8th with sustained winds of 195mph with gusts of 235mph, a storm surge of 6 meters with waves as high as 12 meters, and affected around 16 million people.<sup><a href"http://unocha.com">[1]</a></sup></aside>

				<aside class="notes">The American Red Cross didn't know we were going to be called up but started to do a data scramble to prep just encase staff were deployed. This map shows the state of OSM in the hard hit town of Tolusa, Leyte on November 8th. We were basically planning on sending people out the door with big blank pieces of paper.</aside>

			<section data-background="images/72hours.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Andrew Buck again sent an email letting the HOT list that mappers had all ready mapped over 10,000 buildings in the city of Tacloban in the 24 hours before the storm.</aside>

			<section data-background="images/owenincircles.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Working on an activation is a little like running in a circle over and over and over again. Its highly repetitive work. But as you can see its also a lot of fun.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/coordination.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">"have you guys officially activated yet?" after watching the wonderful work by 40 or 50 mappers it was time to start to call in the big guns</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/german-red-cross-haiyan.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">"where are your staff going, we can prioritize those areas" Red Cross staff was literally getting on planes and we didn't know there final destination. Working with HOT is great because they don't want to waste volunteer efforts. The priority areas were the ones where humanitarian staff would be going.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/GlobalERUdeployment.png" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Where should we go? The global Red Cross network would deploy some 200+ international delegates.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/helpus.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">At this point we were using media reports to drive our mapping and guessing where our staff would be deployed. Everyone new that Tacloban got hit hard but the outlying rural areas were also of great concern.</aside>

				<h1 style="color:black"><em>"I got authority to release."</em></h1>
				<aside class="notes">Then out of no where the US Government really stepped up. The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency started giving us flood extents and damage assessments.</aside>

			<section data-background="images/haiyan_iss.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">In the first couple days loads of people talked and talked about the need for aerial imagery. The need was very high, the desire to provide it was very high, but you know Haiyan was a big bad !@#$ing storm.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/haiyan_iss.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">"Let's just identify villages while we wait for better imagery." Sometimes its tough know what to do and where to map. A lot of the work is based on the available imagery.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/awesome.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Folks in the USG including the DoS HIU and National Geospatial Intelligence Agency were awesome and always gave us great relevant data in spatial formats we could use with open data licenses. When we got data either from the USG or other reliable places we would immediately share it with the HOT team to prioritize tasks for not only the hardest hit areas but the areas where Humanitarian aid would be going first and then working out from there.</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/hiu_imagery.png" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Imagery or the lack there of is a huge limiting factor for remote mappers and HOT, projects like ITTC make HOT activations that much better</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/theif.gif" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">Because we couldn't get other data we needed we started mining websites and reverse engineering web services to get data. We used an army of volunteers who donated time over weekends and at night to free data locked away in pdfs to create real usable data, this data included storm surge, population datasets, and transportation information</aside>
			</section>
			<section data-background="images/haiyan_tasks.png" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">the core of what the HOT does is organized around the tasking manager, it guides us, it tells us how much we've done, and it judges us when we don't validate tasks</aside>
