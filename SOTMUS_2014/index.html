				<aside class="notes">Folks in the USG were awesome and always gave us great relevant data in spatial formats we could use with open data licenses. When we got data either from the USG or other reliable places we would immediately share it with the HOT team to prioritize tasks for not only the hardest hit areas but the areas where Humanitarian aid would be going first and then working out from there.</aside>
